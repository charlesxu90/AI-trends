Estimating the Impact of Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior on Content Recommendations in Social Networks,2022,ICML,"['Swapneel S Mehta', 'Atilim Gunes Baydin', 'Bogdan State', 'Richard Bonneau', 'Jonathan Nagler', 'Philip Torr']",oral,"['coordinated inauthentic behavior', 'agent based modeling', 'recommender systems', 'social networks']","Online disinformation is a dynamic and pervasive problem on social networks as evidenced by a spate of public disasters in light of active efforts to combat it.
Since the massive amounts of content generated each day on these platforms is impossible to manually curate, ranking and recommendation algorithms are a key apparatus that drive user interactions.
However, the vulnerability of ranking and recommendation algorithms to attack from coordinated campaigns spreading misleading information has been established both theoretically and anecdotally.
Unfortunately it is unclear how effective countermeasures to disinformation are in practice due to the limited view we have into the operation of such platforms.
We develop a multiagent simulation of a popular social network, Reddit, that aligns with the state-action space available to real users based on the platform's affordances. 
We collect millions of real-world interactions from Reddit to estimate the network for each user in our dataset and utilise Reddit's self-described content ranking strategies to compare the impact of coordinated activity on content spread by each algorithm.
We expect that this will inform the design of robust content distribution systems that are resilient against targeted attacks by groups of malicious actors.

Differentiable agent-based epidemiological modeling for end-to-end learning,2022,ICML,"['Ayush Chopra', 'Alexander Rodr√≠guez', 'Jayakumar Subramanian', 'Balaji Krishnamurthy', 'B. Aditya Prakash', 'Ramesh Raskar']",oral,"['Paper', 'Computational Epidemiology', 'Agent-based Models', 'Differentiable Simulations']","Mechanistic simulators are an indispensable tool for epidemiology to explore the behavior of complex, dynamic infections under varying conditions and navigate uncertain environments. ODE-based models are the dominant paradigm that enable fast simulations and are tractable to gradient-based optimization, but make simplifying assumptions about population homogeneity. Agent-based models (ABMs) are an increasingly popular alternative paradigm that can represent the heterogeneity of contact interactions with granular detail and agency of individual behavior. However, conventional ABM frameworks are not differentiable and present challenges in scalability; due to which it is non-trivial to connect them to auxiliary data sources easily. In this paper we introduce GradABM which is a new scalable, fast and differentiable design for epidemiological ABMs. GradABM runs simulations with million-size populations in few seconds on commodity hardware and enables fast forward and differentiable inverse simulations. This makes it amenable to be merged with deep neural networks and seamlessly integrate heterogeneous data sources to help with calibration, forecasting and policy evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of GradABM via extensive experiments with real COVID-19 and influenza datasets. We are optimistic that the current work will bring ABM and AI communities closer together.

However, there is limited work in understanding and interpreting their learned representations. In this paper, we study the representation space of several state-of-the-art self-supervised models including SimCLR, SwaV, MoCo V2 and BYOL. Without the use of class label information, we first discover discriminative features that are highly active for various subsets of samples and correspond to unique physical attributes in images. We show that, using such discriminative features, one can compress the representation space of self-supervised models up to 50% without affecting downstream linear classification significantly. Next, we propose a sample-wise Self-Supervised Representation Quality Score (or, Q-Score) that can be computed without access to any label information. Q-Score, utilizes discriminative features to reliably predict if a given sample is likely to be mis-classified in the downstream classification task achieving AUPRC of 0.91 on SimCLR and BYOL trained on ImageNet-100. Q-Score can also be used as a regularization term to remedy low-quality representations leading up to 8% relative improvement in accuracy on all 4 self-supervised baselines on ImageNet-100, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10.

Evaluating and Improving Robustness of Self-Supervised Representations to Spurious Correlations,2022,ICML,"['Kimia Hamidieh', 'Haoran Zhang', 'Marzyeh Ghassemi']",poster,"['Representation Learning', 'Self-Supervised Learning', 'Spurious Correlations']","Recent empirical studies have found inductive biases in supervised learning toward simple features that may be spuriously correlated with the label, resulting in suboptimal performance on minority subgroups. Despite the growing popularity of methods which learn representations from unlabeled data, it is unclear how potential spurious features may be manifested in the learnt representations. In this work, we explore whether recent Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods would produce representations which exhibit similar behaviors under spurious correlation. First, we show that classical approaches in combating spurious correlations, such as dataset re-sampling during SSL, do not consistently lead to invariant representation. Second, we find that spurious information is represented disproportionately heavily in the later layers of the encoder. Motivated by these findings, we propose a method to remove spurious information from these representations during pre-training, by pruning or re-initializing later layers of the encoder.

The model is trained in a method similar to Domain Adversarial training, where we define the source and target domains as the dataset and its augmented versions with minimal texture information (edge maps and stylized images), respectively. We show that using domain invariant learning to capture a prior based on the shape-texture information helps models learn robust representations. We perform extensive experiments on three subsets of ImageNet, namely, ImageNet-20, ImageNet-200, ImageNet-9.

Invariance Discovery for Systematic Generalization in Reinforcement Learning,2022,ICML,"['Mirco Mutti', 'Riccardo De Santi', 'Emanuele Rossi', 'Juan Felipe Calderon', 'Michael M. Bronstein', 'Marcello Restelli']",poster,[],"In the sequential decision making setting, an agent aims to achieve systematic generalization over a large, possibly infinite, set of environments. Such environments are modeled as discrete Markov decision processes with both states and actions represented through a feature vector. The underlying structure of the environments allows the transition dynamics to be factored into two components: one that is environment-specific and another one that is shared. Consider a set of environments that share the laws of motion as an illustrative example. In this setting, the agent can take a finite amount of reward-free interactions from a subset of these environments. The agent then must be able to approximately solve any planning task defined over any environment in the original set, relying on the above interactions only. Can we design a provably efficient algorithm that achieves this ambitious goal of systematic generalization? In this paper, we give a partially positive answer to this question. First, we provide the first tractable formulation of systematic generalization by employing a causal viewpoint. Then, under specific structural assumptions, we provide a simple learning algorithm that allows us to guarantee any desired planning error up to an unavoidable sub-optimality term, while showcasing a polynomial sample complexity.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/c1dce4f3c73618211aa7493c13e7ee70fbcb7865.pdf

Through an extensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that these methods can be counter-productive: they are unable to remove the attributes entirely, and in the worst case may end up destroying all task-relevant features. The reason is the methods' reliance on a probing classifier as a proxy for the attribute, which we prove is difficult to train correctly in presence of spurious correlation.

Different from images, the complex nature of graphs poses unique challenges to adopting the invariance principle. In particular, distribution shifts on graphs can appear in a variety of forms such as attributes and structures, making it difficult to identify the invariance. Moreover, domain or environment partitions, which are often required by OOD methods on Euclidean data, could be highly expensive to obtain for graphs. To bridge this gap, we propose a new framework to capture the invariance of graphs for guaranteed OOD generalization under various distribution shifts. Specifically, we characterize potential distribution shifts on graphs with causal models, concluding that OOD generalization on graphs is achievable when models focus only on subgraphs containing the most information about the causes of labels. Accordingly, we propose an information-theoretic objective to extract the desired subgraphs that maximally preserve the invariant intra-class information. Learning with these subgraphs is immune to distribution shifts.

Policy Architectures for Compositional Generalization in Control,2022,ICML,"['Allan Zhou', 'Vikash Kumar', 'Chelsea Finn', 'Aravind Rajeswaran']",poster,"['mdp', 'invariance', 'rl']","Several tasks in control, robotics, and planning can be specified through desired goal configurations for entities in the environment. Learning goal-conditioned policies is a natural paradigm to solve such tasks. Current approaches, however, struggle to learn and generalize as task complexity increases, such as due to variations in number of entities or compositions of goals. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce the Entity-Factored Markov Decision Process (EFMDP), a formal framework for modeling the entity-based compositional structure in control tasks. Subsequently, we outline policy architecture choices that can successfully leverage the geometric properties of the EFMDP model. Our framework theoretically motivates the use of Self-Attention and Deep Set architectures for control, and results in flexible policies that can be trained end-to-end with standard reinforcement and imitation learning algorithms. On a suite of simulated robot manipulation tasks, we find that these architectures achieve significantly higher success rates with less data, compared to the standard multilayer perceptron.

In this paper, we introduce unsupervised learning under Latent Label Shift (LLS), where label marginals $p_d(y)$ shift but class conditionals $p(\mathbf{x}|y)$ do not. This setting suggests a new principle for identifying classes: elements that shift together across domains belong to the same true class. For finite input spaces, we establish an isomorphism between LLS and topic modeling; for continuous data, we show that if each label's support contains a separable region, analogous to an anchor word, oracle access to $p(d|\mathbf{x})$ suffices to identify $p_d(y)$ and $p_d(y|\mathbf{x})$ up to permutation of latent labels. Thus motivated, we introduce a practical algorithm that leverages domain-discriminative models as follows: (i) push examples through domain discriminator $p(d|\mathbf{x})$; (ii) discretize the data by clustering examples in $p(d|\mathbf{x})$ space; (iii) perform non-negative matrix factorization on the discrete data; (iv) combine recovered $p(y|d)$ with discriminator outputs $p(d|\mathbf{x})$ to compute $p_d(y|\mathbf{x}) \; \forall d$.

Unfortunately, group information may be expensive to obtain; thus, recent works in robustness and fairness have proposed ways to improve worst-group performance even when group labels are unavailable. However, these methods generally underperform methods that utilize group information at training time. In this work, we assume access to a small number of group labels alongside a larger dataset without group labels. We propose BARACK, a simple two-step framework to utilize this partial group information to improve worst-group performance: train a model to predict the missing group labels for the training data, and then use these predicted group labels in a robust optimization objective. Theoretically, we provide generalization bounds for our approach in terms of the worst-group performance, which scale with respect to both the total number of training points and the number of training points with group labels. Empirically, across four spurious correlation and robustness benchmark tasks, our method outperforms the baselines that do not use group information, even when only 1-33% of points have group labels.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/b8bbc7783923fa19a65e28eb5062edc8d2062b10.pdf

We discuss how to evaluate whether a model has formed an environment-invariant internal representation - as opposed to an invariant final classifier function - and propose an objective that encourages learning such a representation.

Invariant and Transportable Representations for Anti-Causal Domain Shifts,2022,ICML,"['Yibo Jiang', 'Victor Veitch']",poster,"['causality', 'spurious correlation', 'invariant prediction', 'domain shift', 'image classification', 'domain adaptation']","Real-world classification problems must contend with domain shift, the (potential) mismatch between the domain where a model is deployed and the domain(s) where the training data was gathered. Methods to handle such problems must specify what structure is common between the domains and what varies. A natural assumption is that causal (structural) relationships are invariant in all domains. Then, it is tempting to learn a predictor for label $Y$ that depends only on its causal parents. However, many real-world problems are ``anti-causal'' in the sense that $Y$ is a cause of the covariates $X$---in this case, $Y$ has no causal parents and the naive causal invariance is useless. In this paper, we study representation learning under a particular notion of domain shift that both respects causal invariance and that naturally handles the ``anti-causal'' structure. We show how to leverage the shared causal structure of the domains to learn a representation that both admits an invariant predictor and that also allows fast adaptation in new domains. The key is to translate causal assumptions into learning principles that disentangle ``invariant'' and ``non-stable'' features. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm.

Contrastive Adapters for Foundation Model Group Robustness,2022,ICML,"['Michael Zhang', 'Christopher Re']",poster,"['foundation models', 'adapters', 'group robustness', 'large pretrained models']","While large pretrained foundation models (FMs) have shown remarkable zero-shot classification robustness to dataset-level distribution shifts, their robustness to group shifts is relatively underexplored. We study this problem, and first find that popular FMs such as CLIP may not be robust to various group shifts. On prior robustness benchmarks, they achieve up to an 80.7 percentage point (pp) gap between average and worst-group accuracy. Unfortunately, current methods to improve robustness require retraining, which can be prohibitively expensive for large FMs. We find existing ways to efficiently improve large model inference, e.g., by training adapters (lightweight MLPs) on top of FM embeddings, can also hurt group robustness compared to zero-shot. We thus propose a first adapter training method designed to improve FM robustness to group shifts. While prior work only trains adapters with class labels, we add a contrastive objective to explicitly learn similar embeddings for initially dissimilar FM embeddings. Across the same benchmarks, contrastive adapting effectively and efficiently improves group robustness, raising worst-group accuracy by 16.0 to 56.0 pp over zero-shot without any FM finetuning. Beyond FM robustness, contrastive adapting achieves near-state-of-the-art robustness on Waterbirds and CelebA, while only training 1% of other methods' model parameters.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/21abed5751b4ce1e0151558259a914f0bacd677a.pdf

However, invariance learning is expensive and data intensive for popular neural architectures. We introduce the notion of amortizing invariance learning. In an up-front learning phase, we learn a low-dimensional manifold of feature extractors spanning invariance to different transformations using a hyper-network. Then, for any problem of interest, both model and invariance learning are rapid and efficient by fitting a low-dimensional invariance descriptor an output head. Empirically, this framework can identify appropriate invariances in different downstream tasks and lead to comparable or better test performance than conventional approaches.

However, we attribute this phenomenon to the limitations that the labeling mechanism employed by humans imposes on the learning algorithm. We conjecture that providing multiple labels for each datapoint where each could describe the existence of particular objects/concepts on the data point, decreases the risk of capturing non-generalizable correlations by the model. We theoretically show that learning over a multi-label regime, where $K$ labels for each data point are present, tightens the expected generalization gap by a factor of $1/\sqrt{K}$ compared to a similar case where only one label for each data point is in hand.

Such a modular decomposition of knowledge enables adaptation to distributions shifts by only updating a subset of parameters. In this work, we systematically study the generalization and adaption performance of such modular neural causal models by comparing it to monolithic models and structured models where the set of predictors is not constrained to causal parents.

A Unified Causal View of Domain Invariant Representation Learning,2022,ICML,"['Zihao Wang', 'Victor Veitch']",poster,[]," Machine learning methods can be unreliable when deployed in domains that differ from the domains on which they were trained. To address this, we may wish to learn representations of data that are domain-invariant in the sense that we preserve data structure that is stable across domains, but throw out spuriously-varying parts. There are many representation-learning approaches of this type, including methods based on data augmentation, distributional invariances, and risk invariance. Unfortunately, when faced with any particular real-world domain shift, it is unclear which, if any, of these methods might be expected to work. The purpose of this paper is to show how the different methods relate to each other, and clarify the real-world circumstances under which each is expected to succeed. The key tool is a new notion of domain shift relying on the idea that causal relationships are invariant, but non-causal relationships (e.g., due to confounding) may vary. Considering this type of domain shift, a natural goal is to learn representations that are ``Counterfactually Invariant''. We find the popular domain-invariant representation learning methods enforce invariance that corresponds to the Counterfactual Invariance under different types of causal structures. Therefore, we should pick the method that matches the underlying causal structure. ",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/7c6d807be20f803b104b37717ea1a983357fb9ce.pdf

Causally motivated multi-shortcut identification and removal,2022,ICML,"['Jiayun Zheng', 'Maggie Makar']",poster,"['shortcut learning', 'spurious correlations', 'causality']","For predictive models to provide reliable guidance in decision making processes, they are often required to be accurate and robust to distribution shift. Shortcut learning--where a model relies on spurious correlations or shortcuts to predict the target label--undermines the robustness property, leading to models with poor out-of-distribution accuracy despite good in-distribution performance. 
Existing work on shortcut learning  either assumes that the set of possible shortcuts is known  a priori or is discoverable using interprability methods such as saliency maps. Instead, we propose a two step approach to (1) efficiently identify relevant shortcuts, and (2) leverage the identified shortcuts to build models that are robust to distribution shifts.  Our approach relies on having access to a (possibly) high dimensional set of auxiliary labels at training time, some of which correspond to possible shortcuts. We show both theoretically and empirically that our approach is able to identify a small sufficient set of shortcuts leading to more efficient predictors in finite samples.

However, there is a lack of insight on how spurious correlations affect the performance of popular self-supervised learning (SSL) and auto-encoder based models (AE). In this work, we shed light on this by evaluating the performance of these models on both real world and synthetic distribution shift datasets. Following observations that the linear head itself can be susceptible to spurious correlations, we develop a new evaluation scheme with the linear head trained on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, to isolate the performance of the pre-trained models from a potential bias of the linear head used for evaluation. With this new methodology, we show that SSL models are consistently more robust to distribution shifts and thus better at OOD generalisation than AE and SL models.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/2210e36b8df67c46b2486ab8f59526a80d2406f6.pdf
Understanding Rare Spurious Correlations in Neural Networks,2022,ICML,"['Yao-Yuan Yang', 'Chi-Ning Chou', 'Kamalika Chaudhuri']",poster,"['rare spurious correlation', 'privacy']","Neural networks are known to use spurious correlations such as background information for classification. While prior work has looked at spurious correlations that are widespread in the training data, in this work, we investigate how sensitive neural networks are to rare spurious correlations, which may be harder to detect and correct, and may lead to privacy leaks.  We introduce spurious patterns correlated with a fixed class to a few training examples and find that it takes only a handful of such examples for the network to learn the correlation. Furthermore, these rare spurious correlations also impact accuracy and privacy. We empirically and theoretically analyze different factors involved in rare spurious correlations and propose mitigation methods accordingly.

Optimization-based Causal Estimation from Heterogenous Environments,2022,ICML,"['Mingzhang Yin', 'Yixin Wang', 'David Blei']",poster,"['Causal estimation', 'Robust prediction', 'Optimization', 'Directional derivative', 'Interventional data']","This paper presents an optimization approach to causal estimation. In classical machine learning, the goal of optimization is to maximize predictive accuracy. However, some   covariates might exhibit non-causal association to the outcome. Such spurious associations provide predictive power for classical ML, but    prevent us from interpreting the result causally.  This paper   proposes CoCo, an optimization algorithm that bridges the gap   between pure prediction and causal inference. CoCo leverages   the recently-proposed idea of environments. Given datasets from multiple   environments---and ones that exhibit enough heterogeneity---CoCo maximizes an objective for which the only solution is the causal solution.

Automated Invariance Testing for Machine Learning Models Using Sparse Linear Layers,2022,ICML,"['Zukang Liao', 'Michael Cheung']",poster,"['Automated invariance testing', 'sparse linear layers', 'feature selection', 'neural networks']","Machine learning testing and evaluation are largely overlooked by the community. In many cases, the only way to conduct testing is through formula-based scores, e.g., accuracy, f1, etc. However, these simple statistical scores cannot fully represent the performance of ML model. Therefore, new testing frameworks are attracting more attention. In this work, we propose a novel invariance testing approach that does not utilise traditional statistical scores. Instead, we train a series of sparse linear layers which are more easily to be compared due to their sparsity. We then use different divergence functions to numerically compare them and fuse the difference scores into a visual matrix. Additionally, testing using sparse linear layers allows us to conduct a novel testing oracle: associativity: by comparing merged weights and weights obtained by combined augmentation. Finally, we assess whether a model is invariant by checking the visual matrix, the associativity, and its sparse layers.

Fairness and robustness in anti-causal prediction,2022,ICML,"['Maggie Makar', ""Alexander D'Amour""]",poster,"['fairness', 'robustness', 'causality']","Robustness to distribution shift and fairness have independently emerged as two important desiderata required of modern machine learning models. Here, we discuss these connections through a causal lens, focusing on anti-causal prediction tasks, where the input to a classifier (e.g., an image) is assumed to be generated as a function of the target label and the protected attribute. By taking this perspective, we draw explicit connections between a common fairness criterion---separation---and a common notion of robustness---risk invariance. These connections provide new motivation for applying the separation criterion in anticausal settings, and show that fairness can be motivated entirely on the basis of achieving better performance. In addition, our findings suggest that robustness-motivated approaches can be used to enforce separation, and that they often work better in practice than methods designed to directly enforce separation. Using a medical dataset, we empirically validate our findings on the task of detecting pneumonia from X-rays, in a setting where differences in prevalence across sex groups motivates a fairness mitigation.

Recent empirically works find that there is a strong linear relationship between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance, but we show that this is not necessarily true if there are subpopulation shifts. In this paper, we empirically show that out-of-distribution performance often has nonlinear correlation with in-distribution performance under subpopulation shifts. To understand this phenomenon, we decompose the model's performance into performance on each subpopulation. We show that there is a ""moon shape"" correlation (parabolic uptrend curve) between the test performance on the majority subpopulation and the minority subpopulation. This nonlinear correlations hold across model architectures, training durations and hyperparameters, and the imbalance between subpopulations. Moreover, we show that the nonlinearity increases in the presence of spurious correlations in the training data. We provide complementary theoretical and experimental analyses for this interesting phenomenon of nonlinear performance correlation across subpopulations.

We find that representations always encode some information about the domain. While the layerwise encoding patterns remain largely stable across different OOD algorithms, they vary across the datasets. For example, the information about rotation (on RotatedMNIST) is the most visible on the lower layers, while the information about style (on VLCS and PACS) is the most visible on the middle layers.

Under some circumstances, including transfer learning from pretrained models, these paths are presumed to be linear. In contrast to existing results, we find that among text classifiers (trained on MNLI, QQP, and CoLA), some pairs of finetuned models have large barriers of increasing loss on the linear paths between them. On each task, we find distinct clusters of models which are linearly connected on the test loss surface, but are disconnected from models outside the cluster---models that occupy separate basins on the surface.

Techniques have been proposed to prevent a network from learning such features, using the heuristic that spurious correlations are ``simple'' and learned preferentially during training by SGD. Recent methods resample or augment training data such that examples displaying spurious correlations (a.k.a. bias-aligned examples) become a minority, whereas the other, bias-conflicting examples become prevalent. These approaches are difficult to train and scale to real-world data, e.g., because they rely on disentangled representations. We propose an alternative based on mixup that augments the bias-conflicting training data with convex combinations of existing examples and their labels. Our method, named SelecMix, applies mixup to selected pairs of examples, which show either (i)~the same label but dissimilar biased features, or (ii)~a different label but similar biased features. To compare examples with respect to the biased features, we use an auxiliary model relying on the heuristic that biased features are learned preferentially during training by SGD.

Conversely, this work proposes to relax both assumptions by learning the effect of maintenance conditional on a machine's characteristics from observational data on similar machines using existing methodologies for causal inference. This way, we can estimate the number of overhauls and failures for different levels of maintenance and, consequently, optimize the preventive maintenance frequency. We validate our proposed approach using real-life data on more than 4,000 maintenance contracts from an industrial partner.

The evolving policy during training will cause state-action visitation distribution shifts. We theoretically analyze how the distribution of historical policies affects the model learning and model rollouts. We then propose a novel model-based RL method, named \textit{Policy-adaptation Model-based Actor-Critic (PMAC)}, which learns a policy-adapted dynamics model based on a policy-adaptation mechanism. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the historical policy mixture distribution to ensure the learned model can continually adapt to the state-action visitation distribution of the evolving policy.

However, an example might be considered hard for several distinct reasons, such as being a member of a rare subpopulation, being mislabeled, or being fundamentally ambiguous in their class. In this paper, we focus on the second-split forgetting time (SSFT): the epoch (if any) after which an original training example is forgotten as the network is fine-tuned on a randomly held out partition of the data. Across multiple benchmark datasets and modalities, we demonstrate that mislabeled examples are forgotten quickly, and seemingly rare examples are forgotten comparatively slowly.

The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenges (SMAC) recognized as a standard benchmark of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is mainly concerned with ensuring that all agents cooperatively eliminate approaching adversaries only through fine manipulation with obvious reward functions. SMAC$^{+}$, on the other hand, is interested in the ability of MARL algorithms to effectively discover sub-tasks. In the offensive scenarios, agents must learn to find opponents first and then eliminate them, and the defensive scenarios need agents to use topographic features such as placing behind structures to lower the possibility of being attacked by enemies. In these scenarios, MARL algorithms must learn indirectly how they accomplish sub-tasks without direct incentives. We investigate MARL algorithms under SMAC$^{+}$ and observe that recent approaches work well in similar settings to the previous challenges but misbehave in offensive scenarios, even when training time is significantly extended. We also discover that risk-based extra exploration approach has a positive effect on performance through the completion of sub-tasks.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/c3ccf69b5122ac21a1c4481f8810b7d6d904e55e.pdf

Calibrating Agent-based Models to Microdata with Graph Neural Networks,2022,ICML,"['Joel Dyer', 'Patrick Cannon', 'J. Doyne Farmer', 'Sebastian M Schmon']",spotlight,"['simulation-based inference', 'graph neural networks', 'microdata', 'agent-based models']","Calibrating agent-based models to data is among the most fundamental requirements to ensure the model fulfils its desired purpose. In recent years, simulation-based inference methods have emerged as powerful tools for performing this task when the model likelihood function is intractable, as is often the case for agent-based models. In some real-world use cases of agent-based models, both the observed data and the agent-based model output consist of the agents' states and their interactions over time. In such cases, there is a tension between the desire to make full use of the rich information content of such granular data on the one hand, and the need to reduce the dimensionality of the data to prevent difficulties associated with high-dimensional learning tasks on the other. A possible resolution is to construct lower-dimensional time-series through the use of summary statistics describing the macrostate of the system at each time point. However, a poor choice of summary statistics can result in an unacceptable loss of information from the original dataset, dramatically reducing the quality of the resulting calibration. In this work, we instead propose to learn parameter posteriors associated with granular microdata directly using temporal graph neural networks. We will demonstrate that such an approach offers highly compelling inductive biases for Bayesian inference using the raw agent-based model microstates as output.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/e05894b81f11d7e2b8dbec65165da1f64d98674e.pdf
Generating Diverse Cooperative Agents by Learning Incompatible Policies,2022,ICML,"['Rujikorn Charakorn', 'Poramate Manoonpong', 'Nat Dilokthanakul']",spotlight,"['multi-agent systems', 'cooperative', 'reinforcement learning', 'diversity', 'paper']","Effectively training a robust agent that can cooperate with unseen agents requires diverse training partner agents. Nonetheless, obtaining cooperative agents with diverse behaviors is a challenging task. Previous work proposes learning a diverse set of agents by diversifying the state-action distribution of the agents. However, without information about the task's goal, the diversified behaviors are not motivated to find other important, albeit non-optimal, solutions, resulting in only local variations of a solution. In this work, we propose to learn diverse behaviors by looking at policy compatibility while using state-action information to induce local variations of behaviors. Conceptually, policy compatibility measures whether policies of interest can collectively solve a task. We posit that incompatible policies can be behaviorally different. Based on this idea, we propose a novel objective to learn diverse behaviors. We theoretically show that our novel objective can generate a dissimilar policy, which we incorporate into a population-based training scheme.

Effective Offline RL Needs Going Beyond Pessimism: Representations and Distributional Shift,2022,ICML,"['Xinyang Geng', 'Kevin Li', 'Abhishek Gupta', 'Aviral Kumar', 'Sergey Levine']",poster,"['Offline reinforcement learning', 'representation leanring']","Standard off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods based on temporal difference (TD) learning generally fail to learn good policies when applied to static offline datasets. Conventionally, this is attributed to distribution shift, where the Bellman backup queries high-value out-of-distribution (OOD) actions for the next time step, which then leads to systematic overestimation. However, this explanation is incomplete, as conservative offline RL methods that directly address overestimation still suffer from stability problems in practice. This suggests that although OOD actions may account for part of the challenge, the difficulties with TD learning in the offline setting are also deeply connected to other aspects such as the quality of representations of learned function approximators. In this work, we demonstrate that merely imposing pessimism is not sufficient for good performance, and demonstrate empirically that regularizing representations actually accounts for a large part of the improvement observed in modern offline RL methods. Building on this insight, we identify concrete metrics that enable effective diagnosis of the quality of the learned representation, and are able to adequately predict performance of the underlying method. Finally, we show that a simple approach for handling representations, without any changing any other aspect of conservative offline RL algorithms can lead to better performance in several offline RL problems.

We propose a hyperbolic discounting-based advantage estimation method that makes the agent aware of and robust to the underlying uncertainty of survival and episode duration. On the challenging RL generalization benchmark Procgen, our proposed approach achieves up to 200\% performance improvement over the PPO baseline that uses classical exponential discounting.

Traditional RL algorithms learn a value function defined for a single policy. A recently explored competitive alternative is to learn a single value function for many policies. Here we combine the actor-critic architecture of Parameter-Based Value Functions and the policy embedding of Policy Evaluation Networks to learn a single value function for evaluating (and thus helping to improve) any policy represented by a deep neural network (NN). The method yields competitive experimental results. In continuous control problems with infinitely many states, our value function minimizes its prediction error by simultaneously learning a small set of  `probing states' and a mapping from actions produced in probing states to the policy's return. The method extracts crucial abstract knowledge about the environment in form of very few states sufficient to fully specify the behavior of many policies. A policy improves solely by changing actions in probing states, following the gradient of the value function's predictions. Surprisingly, it is possible to clone the behavior of a near-optimal policy in Swimmer-v3 and Hopper-v3 environments only by knowing how to act in 3 and 5 such learned states, respectively.

To alleviate this, unsupervised RL proposes to collect data through self-supervised interaction to accelerate task-specific adaptation. However, whether current unsupervised strategies lead to improved generalization capabilities is still unclear, more so when the input observations are high-dimensional. In this work, we advance the field by closing the performance gap in the Unsupervised RL Benchmark, a collection of tasks to be solved in a data-efficient manner, after interacting with the environment in a self-supervised way.

For agents to scale to the real world, they will need to react to and reason about unseen combinations of objects. We argue that the ability to recognize and use local factorization in transition dynamics is a key element in unlocking the power of multi-object reasoning. To this end, we show that (1) known local structure in the environment transitions is sufficient for an exponential reduction in the sample complexity of training a dynamics model, and (2) a locally factored dynamics model provably generalizes out-of-distribution to unseen states and actions. Knowing the local structure also allows us to predict which unseen states and actions this dynamics model will generalize to. We propose to leverage these observations in a novel Model-based Counterfactual Data Augmentation (MoCoDA) framework.

MoCoDA works with a broader set of local structures than prior work and allows for direct control over the augmented training distribution.

DASCO: Dual-Generator Adversarial Support Constrained Offline Reinforcement Learning,2022,ICML,"['quan vuong', 'Aviral Kumar', 'Sergey Levine', 'Yevgen Chebotar']",poster,"['Offline Reinforcement Learning', 'Generative Adversarial Networks']","In offline RL, constraining the learned policy to remain close to the data is essential to prevent the policy from outputting out-of-distribution (OOD) actions with erroneously overestimated values. In principle, generative adversarial networks (GAN) can provide an elegant solution to do so, with the discriminator directly providing a probability that quantifies distributional shift. However, in practice, GAN-based offline RL methods have not outperformed alternative approaches, perhaps because the generator is trained to both fool the discriminator and maximize return - two objectives that are often at odds with each other. In this paper, we show that the issue of conflicting objectives can be resolved by training two generators: one that maximizes return, with the other capturing the ""remainder"" of the data distribution in the offline dataset, such that the mixture of the two is close to the behavior policy. We show that not only does having two generators enable an effective GAN-based offline RL method, but also approximates a support constraint, where the policy does not need to match the entire data distribution, but only the slice of the data that leads to high long term performance. We name our method DASCO, for Dual-Generator Adversarial Support Constrained Offline RL. On benchmark tasks that require learning from sub-optimal data, DASCO significantly outperforms prior methods that enforce distribution constraint.

Representation Gap in Deep Reinforcement Learning,2022,ICML,"['Qiang He', 'Huangyuan Su', 'Jieyu Zhang', 'Xinwen Hou']",poster,"['deep reinforcement learning', 'representation learning', 'policy evaluation']","Deep reinforcement learning gives the promise that an agent learns good policy from high-dimensional information. Whereas representation learning removes irrelevant and redundant information and retains pertinent information. We consider the representation capacity of action value function and theoretically reveal its inherent property, representation gap with its target action value function. This representation gap is favorable. However, through illustrative experiments, we show that the representation of action value function grows similarly compared with its target value function, i.e. the undesirable inactivity of the representation gap (representation overlap). Representation overlap results in a loss of representation capacity, which further leads to sub-optimal learning performance. To activate the representation gap, we propose a simple but effective framework Policy Optimization from Preventing Representation Overlaps (POPRO), which regularizes the policy evaluation phase through differing the representation of action value function from its target. We also provide the convergence rate guarantee of POPRO. We evaluate POPRO on gym continuous control suites. The empirical results show that POPRO using pixel inputs outperforms or parallels the sample-efficiency of methods that use state-based features.

In this paper, we seek to establish simple baselines for continuous control in the visual domain. We show that simple modifications to two state-of-the-art vision-based online reinforcement learning algorithms, DreamerV2 and DrQ-v2, suffice to outperform prior work and establish a competitive baseline. We rigorously evaluate these algorithms on both existing offline datasets and a new testbed for offline reinforcement learning from visual observations that better represents the data distributions present in real-world offline RL problems, and open-source our code and data to facilitate progress in this important domain.

However, teaching and giving feedback on such software is hard ‚Äî standard approaches require instructors to hand grade student-implemented interactive programs. As a result, online platforms that serve millions, like Code.org, are unable to provide any feedback on assignments for implementing interactive programs, which critically hinders students‚Äô ability to learn. Recent work proposes to train reinforcement learning agents to interact with a student‚Äôs program, aiming to explore states indicative of errors. However, this approach only provides binary feedback of whether a program is correct or not, while students require finer-grained feedback on the specific errors in their programs to understand their mistakes. In this work, we show that exploring to discover errors can be cast as a meta-exploration problem. This enables us to construct a principled objective for discovering errors and an algorithm for optimizing this objective, which provides fine-grained feedback. We evaluate our approach on a set of 700K real anonymized student programs from a Code.org interactive assignment.

A critical challenge to such autonomy is the presence of irreversible states which require external assistance to recover from, such as when a robot arm has pushed an object off of a table.

To this end, we propose an algorithm that can efficiently learns to detect and avoid states that are irreversible, and proactively ask for help in case the agent does enter them.

Beyond the Return: Off-policy Function Estimation under User-specified Error-measuring Distributions,2022,ICML,"['Audrey Huang', 'Nan Jiang']",poster,[],"Off-policy evaluation often refers to two related tasks: estimating the expected return of a policy and estimating its value function (or other functions of interest, such as density ratios). While recent works on marginalized importance sampling (MIS) show that the former can enjoy provable guarantees under realizable function approximation, the latter is only known to be feasible under much stronger assumptions such as prohibitively expressive discriminators. In this work, we provide guarantees for off-policy function estimation under only realizability, by imposing proper regularization on the MIS objectives. Compared to commonly used regularization in MIS, our regularizer is much more flexible and can account for an arbitrary user-specified distribution, under which the learned function will be close to the ground truth. We provide exact characterization of the optimal dual solution that needs to be realized by the discriminator class, which determines the data-coverage assumption in the case of value-function learning. As another surprising observation, the regularizer can be altered to relax the data-coverage requirement, and completely eliminate it in the ideal case with strong side information.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/7079e872905e216376177217fc2e75efe9c1cdc7.pdf
Maximum-Likelihood Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Finite-Time Guarantees,2022,ICML,"['Siliang Zeng', 'Chenliang Li', 'Alfredo Garcia', 'Mingyi Hong']",poster,"['Inverse Reinforcement Learning', 'Reward Identification']","Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to recover the reward function and the associated optimal policy that best fits observed sequences of states and actions implemented by an expert. Many algorithms for IRL have an inherent nested structure: the inner loop finds the optimal policy given parametrized rewards while the outer loop updates the estimates towards optimizing a measure of fit. For high dimensional environments such nested-loop structure entails a significant computational burden. To reduce the computational burden of a nested loop, novel methods such as SQIL [1] and IQ-Learn [2] emphasize policy estimation at the expense of reward estimation accuracy. However, without accurate estimated rewards, it is not possible to do counterfactual analysis such as predicting the optimal policy under different environment dynamics and/or learning new tasks. In this paper we develop a novel single-loop algorithm for IRL that does not compromise reward estimation accuracy. In the proposed algorithm, each policy improvement step is followed by a stochastic gradient step for likelihood maximization. We show that the proposed algorithm provably converges to a stationary solution with a finite-time guarantee. If the reward is parameterized linearly, we show the identified solution corresponds to the solution of the maximum entropy IRL problem. Finally, by using robotics control problems in Mujoco and their transfer settings, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance compared with other IRL and imitation learning benchmarks.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/c5cb90fc7c9f18a8117466bebea2be7bc671dfc0.pdf
You Can‚Äôt Count on Luck: Why Decision Transformers Fail in Stochastic Environments,2022,ICML,"['Keiran Paster', 'Sheila A. McIlraith', 'Jimmy Ba']",poster,"['representation learning', 'reinforcement learning', 'model-based reinforcement learning', 'decision transformer']","Recently, methods such as Decision Transformer that reduce reinforcement learning to a prediction task and solve it via supervised learning (RvS) have become popular due to their simplicity, robustness to hyperparameters, and strong overall performance on offline RL tasks. However, simply conditioning a probabilistic model on a desired return and taking the predicted action can fail dramatically in stochastic environments since trajectories that result in a return may have only achieved that return due to luck. In this work, we describe the limitations of RvS approaches in stochastic environments and propose a solution. Rather than simply conditioning on returns, as is standard practice, our proposed method, ESPER, conditions on learned average returns which are independent from environment stochasticity. Doing so allows ESPER to achieve strong alignment between target return and expected performance in real environments. We demonstrate this in several challenging stochastic offline-RL tasks including the challenging puzzle game 2048, and Connect Four playing against a stochastic opponent. In all tested domains, ESPER achieves significantly better alignment between the target return and achieved return than simply conditioning on returns. ESPER also achieves higher maximum performance than even the value-based baselines.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/7f10fee9201a02dc66ec3d1ff4d9de611114717d.pdf

Our focus in this paper is to study the convergence of the policy gradient method for solving MPGs under softmax policy parameterization, both tabular and parameterized with general function approximators such as neural networks. We first show the asymptotic convergence of this method to a Nash equilibrium of MPGs for tabular softmax policies. Second, we derive the finite-time performance of the policy gradient in two settings: 1)  using the log-barrier regularization, and 2) using the natural policy gradient under the best-response dynamics (NPG-BR). Finally, extending the notion of price of anarchy (POA) and smoothness in normal-form games, we introduce the POA for MPGs and provide a POA bound for NPG-BR. To our knowledge, this is the first POA bound for solving MPGs.

In this work, we develop a framework for meta-RL algorithms that are able to behave appropriately under test-time distribution shifts in the space of tasks. Our framework centers on an adaptive approach to distributional robustness, in which we train a population of meta-agents to be robust to varying levels of distribution shift, so that when evaluated on a (potentially shifted) test-time distribution of tasks, we can adaptively choose the most appropriate meta-agent to follow.

You Only Live Once: Single-Life Reinforcement Learning via Learned Reward Shaping ,2022,ICML,"['Annie S Chen', 'Archit Sharma', 'Sergey Levine', 'Chelsea Finn']",poster,"['reinforcement learning', 'autonomous reinforcement learning', 'adversarial imitation learning']","Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed to learn a performant policy that can repeatedly and autonomously complete a task, typically starting from scratch. However, many real-world situations operate under a different set of assumptions: the goal might not be to learn a policy that can do the task repeatedly, but simply to perform a new task successfully once, ideally as quickly as possible, and while leveraging some prior knowledge or experience. For example, imagine a robot that is exploring another planet, where it cannot get help or supervision from humans. If it needs to navigate to a crater that it has never seen before in search of water, it does not really need to acquire a policy for reaching craters reliably, it only needs to reach this particular crater once. It must do so without the benefit of episodic resets and tackle a new, unknown terrain, but it can leverage prior experience it acquired on Earth. We formalize this problem setting, which we call single-life reinforcement learning (SLRL), where an agent must complete a task once while contending with some form of novelty in a single trial without interventions, given some prior data. In this setting, we find that algorithms designed for standard episodic reinforcement learning can struggle, as they have trouble recovering from novel states especially when informative rewards are not provided. Motivated by this observation, we also propose an algorithm, $Q$-weighted adversarial learning (QWALE), that addresses the dearth of supervision by employing a distribution matching strategy that leverages the agent's prior experience as guidance in novel situations. Our experiments on several single-life continuous control problems indicate that methods based on our distribution matching formulation are 20-60% more successful because they can more quickly recover from novel, out-of-distribution states.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/b8d0ed94a74803868a10b79aeb1b756c7a7651da.pdf

Uncertainty quantification has been extensively used as a means to achieve efficient directed exploration. However, state-of-the-art methods for continuous actions still suffer from high sample complexity requirements. Indeed, they either completely lack strategies for propagating the epistemic uncertainty throughout the updates, or they mix it with aleatory uncertainty while learning the full return distribution (e.g., distributional RL). In this paper, we propose Wasserstein Actor-Critic (WAC), an actor-critic architecture inspired by the recent Wasserstein Q-Learning (WQL) (Metelli et al., 2019), that employs approximate Q-posteriors to represent the epistemic uncertainty and Wasserstein barycenters for uncertainty propagation across the state-action space. WAC enforces exploration in a principled way by guiding the policy learning process with the optimization of an upper bound of the Q-value estimates. Furthermore, we study some peculiar issues that arise when using function approximation, coupled with the uncertainty estimation, and propose a regularized loss for the uncertainty estimation.

Instead, this paper proposes a novel adversarial setting called a Cheap Talk MDP in which an Adversary has a minimal range of influence over the Victim. Parameterised as a deterministic policy that only conditions on the current state, an Adversary can merely append information to a Victim‚Äôs observation. To motivate the minimum-viability, we prove that in this setting the Adversary cannot occlude the ground truth, influence the underlying dynamics of the environment, introduce non-stationarity, add stochasticity, see the Victim‚Äôs actions, or access their parameters. Additionally, we present a novel meta-learning algorithm to train the Adversary, called adversarial cheap talk (ACT). Using ACT, we demonstrate that the resulting Adversary still manages to influence the Victim‚Äôs training and test performance despite these restrictive assumptions. Affecting train-time performance reveals a new attack vector and provides insight into the success and failure modes of existing RL algorithms. More specifically, we show that an ACT Adversary is capable of harming performance by interfering with the learner‚Äôs function approximation and helping the Victim‚Äôs performance by appending useful features.

In this work, we propose a form of linear Q-function decomposition induced by factored action spaces. We study the theoretical properties of our approach, identifying scenarios where it is guaranteed to lead to zero bias when used to approximate the Q-function. Outside the regimes with theoretical guarantees, we show that our approach can still be useful because it leads to better sample efficiency without necessarily sacrificing policy optimality, allowing us to achieve a better bias-variance trade-off. Across several offline RL problems using simulators and real-world datasets motivated by healthcare problems, we demonstrate that incorporating factored action spaces into value-based RL can result in better-performing policies.

We apply our method to DreamerV2, a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, and evaluate it on the DeepMind Control Suite and the Atari k benchmark. The results demonstrate that one can better balance under- and overestimation by adjusting the UTD ratio with our approach compared to the default setting in DreamerV2 and that it is competitive with an extensive hyperparameter search which is not feasible for many applications.

Rather, we model the latent safety context using principled contrastive training on an offline dataset of demonstrations from many tasks, including both negative and positive experiences. Using this latent variable, our RL framework, SAFEty skill pRiors (SAFER) extracts task specific safe primitive skills to safely and successfully generalize to new tasks.

Deciding What to Model: Value-Equivalent Sampling for Reinforcement Learning,2022,ICML,"['Dilip Arumugam', 'Benjamin Van Roy']",poster,"['Reinforcement learning', 'Efficient exploration', 'Information theory', 'Bayesian reinforcement learning', 'Value equivalence']","The quintessential model-based reinforcement-learning agent iteratively refines its estimates or prior beliefs about the true underlying model of the environment. Recent empirical successes in model-based reinforcement learning with function approximation, however, eschew the true model in favor of a surrogate that, while ignoring various facets of the environment, still facilitates effective planning over behaviors. Recently formalized as the value equivalence principle, this algorithmic technique is perhaps unavoidable as real-world reinforcement learning demands consideration of a simple, computationally-bounded agent interacting with an overwhelmingly complex environment, whose underlying dynamics likely exceed the agent's capacity for representation. In this work, we consider the scenario where agent limitations may entirely preclude identifying an exactly value-equivalent model, immediately giving rise to a trade-off between identifying a model that is simple enough to learn while only incurring bounded sub-optimality. To address this problem, we introduce an algorithm that, using rate-distortion theory, iteratively computes an approximately-value-equivalent, lossy compression of the environment which an agent may feasibly target in lieu of the true model. We prove an information-theoretic, Bayesian regret bound for our algorithm that holds for any finite-horizon, episodic sequential decision-making problem. Crucially, our regret bound can be expressed in one of two possible forms, providing a performance guarantee for finding either the simplest model that achieves a desired sub-optimality gap or, alternatively, the best model given a limit on agent capacity.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/4796d8e2a521daafaa5ba31813492f687b240cb1.pdf

MEPG: A Minimalist Ensemble Policy Gradient Framework for Deep Reinforcement Learning,2022,ICML,"['Qiang He', 'Huangyuan Su', 'Chen GONG', 'Xinwen Hou']",poster,"['Reinforcement Learning', 'Ensemble Learning']","During the training of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, the distribution of training data is non-stationary as the agent's behavior changes over time. Therefore, there is a risk that the agent is overspecialized to a particular distribution and its performance suffers in the larger picture. Ensemble RL can mitigate this issue by learning a robust policy. However, it suffers from heavy computational resource consumption due to the newly introduced value and policy functions. In this paper, to avoid the notorious resources consumption issue, we design a novel and simple ensemble deep RL framework that integrates multiple models into a single model. Specifically, we propose the Minimalist Ensemble Policy Gradient framework (MEPG), which introduces minimalist ensemble consistent Bellman update by utilizing a modified dropout operator. MEPG holds ensemble property by keeping the dropout consistency of both sides of the Bellman equation. Additionally, the dropout operator also increases MEPG's generalization capability.

Xu', 'Junxian He', 'Sudipta Sengupta', 'Dan Roth', 'Graham Neubig']",poster,"['nearest', 'neighbors', 'k-nearest neighbors', 'language', 'models', 'automata', 'automaton', 'retomaton']","Retrieval-based language models (R-LM) model the probability of natural language text by combining a standard language model (LM) with examples retrieved from an external datastore at test time. While effective, a major bottleneck of using these models in practice is the computationally costly datastore search, which can be performed as frequently as every time step. In this paper, we present RetoMaton ‚Äì retrieval automaton ‚Äì which approximates the datastore search, based on (1) clustering of entries into ‚Äústates‚Äù, and (2) state transitions from previous entries. This effectively results in a weighted finite automaton built on top of the datastore, instead of representing the datastore as a flat list. The creation of the automaton is unsupervised, and a RetoMaton can be constructed from any text collection: either the original training corpus or from another domain. Traversing this automaton at inference time, in parallel to the LM inference, reduces its perplexity, or alternatively saves up to 83% of the nearest neighbor searches over kNN-LM (Khandelwal et al., 2020), without hurting perplexity.

Matching pre-training and Fine-tuning Methods for Knowledge Retrieval from pretrained Language Models,2022,ICML,['Ahmad Pouramini'],poster,"['Pretrained Language Models', 'Commonsense Knowledge', 'KB Completion']","In this paper we study different methods for pre-training and fine-tuning a transformer-based language model for generating commonsense knowledge or the KB completion task in few-shot settings. The model can be trained in unsupervised and supervised methods with different pre-training objectives. We investigate the effect of each type of these training objectives on the performance of the model in knowledge generationand retrieval. We analyze the results from both plausibility and variety and novelty aspects. The results show that mixing both objectives in pre-training and fine-tuning stages can provide more novel and accurate results in few shot settings.

Then, it learns the latent representation space using graph-text multi-modal contrastive learning which ensures that the generated texts have high similarity to the retrieved subgraphs.

However, these procedures are often misaligned in that training objectives do not exactly reflect the retrieval scenario at inference time. In this paper, we explore how the gap between training and inference in dense retrieval can be reduced, focusing on dense phrase retrieval (Lee et al., 2021) where billions of representations are indexed at inference. Since validating every dense retriever with a large-scale index is practically infeasible, we propose an efficient way of validating dense retrievers using a small subset of the entire corpus. This allows us to validate various training strategies including unifying contrastive loss terms and using hard negatives for phrase retrieval, which largely reduces the training-inference discrepancy. As a result, we improve phrase retrieval by 2-3% in top-1 accuracy and passage retrieval by 2-4% in top-20 accuracy for open-domain question answering. Our work urges modeling dense retrievers with careful consideration of training and inference via efficient validation while advancing phrase retrieval as a general solution for dense retrieval.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/5c8cdbbb0ccd089bc0699bcc247ff02cf80aad32.pdf

However, conversational question answering (ConvQA) systems have long been stymied by scarce training data that is expensive to collect. To address this problem, we propose a new technique for synthetically generating diverse and high-quality dialog data: dialog inpainting. Our approach takes the text of any document and transforms it into a two-person dialog between the writer and an imagined reader: we treat sentences from the article as utterances spoken by the writer, and then use a dialog inpainter to predict what the imagined reader asked or said in between each of the writer's utterances. By applying this approach to passages from Wikipedia and the web, we produce WikiDialog and WebDialog, two datasets totalling 19 million diverse information-seeking dialogs---1,000x larger than the largest existing ConvQA dataset. Furthermore, human raters judge the answer adequacy and conversationality of WikiDialog to be as good or better than existing manually-collected datasets. Using our inpainted data to pre-train ConvQA retrieval systems, we significantly advance state-of-the-art across three benchmarks, yielding up to 40% relative gains on standard evaluation metrics.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/0c36dbb0635d1d3620938784ad897a95adf0fd0e.pdf

Experimental results demonstrate that our Zero-shot-CoT, using the same single prompt template, significantly outperforms zero-shot LLM performances on diverse benchmark reasoning tasks including arithmetics (MultiArith, GSM8K, AQUA-RAT, SVAMP), symbolic reasoning (Last Letter, Coin Flip), and other logical reasoning tasks(Date Understanding, Tracking Shuffled Objects), without any hand-crafted few-shot examples, e.g. increasing the accuracy on MultiArith from 17.7% to 78.7% and GSM8K from 10.4% to 40.7% with an 175B parameter Instruct-GPT, as well as similar magnitudes of improvements with  540B parameter PaLM.

It has been shown that this pre-training leads to improved efficiency in downstream supervised tasks later given to the agent to solve. When dealing with the unsupervised pre-training in multiple environments one should also account for potential trade-offs in the exploration performance within the set of environments, which leads to the following question: Can we pre-train a policy that is simultaneously optimal in all the environments?

Investigating Why Contrastive Learning Benefits Robustness against Label Noise,2022,ICML,"['Yihao Xue', 'Kyle Whitecross', 'Baharan Mirzasoleiman']",poster,"['robustness', 'contrastive learning', 'pretraining']","Self-supervised contrastive learning has recently been shown to be very effective in preventing deep networks from overfitting noisy labels. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of the effect of contrastive learning on boosting robustness is very limited. In this work, we rigorously prove that learned the representation matrix has certain desirable properties in terms its SVD that benefit robustness against label noise. We further show that the low-rank structure of the Jacobian of deep networks pre-trained with contrastive learning allows them to achieve a superior performance initially, when fine-tuned on noisy labels. Finally, we demonstrate that the initial robustness provided by contrastive learning enables robust training methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance under extreme noise levels.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/e1d75c8a6eaf47d462bfc10f8c0c927438285027.pdf
Pretraining a Neural Network before Knowing Its Architecture,2022,ICML,['Boris Knyazev'],poster,"['hypernetworks', 'efficient pretraining', 'few-shot transfer learning', 'fine-tuning', 'orthogonal parameters']","Training large neural networks is possible by training a smaller hypernetwork that predicts parameters for the large ones. A recently released Graph HyperNetwork (GHN) trained this way on one million of smaller ImageNet architectures is able to predict parameters for large unseen networks such as ResNet-50. While networks with predicted parameters lose performance on the source task, the predicted parameters have been found useful for fine-tuning on other tasks. We study if fine-tuning based on the same GHN is still useful on novel strong architectures that were published after the GHN had been trained. We found that for recent architectures such as ConvNeXt, GHN initialization becomes less useful than for ResNet-50. One potential reason is the increased distribution shift of novel architectures from those used to train the GHN. We also found that the predicted parameters lack the diversity necessary to successfully fine-tune parameters with gradient descent. We alleviate this limitation by applying simple post-processing techniques to predicted parameters before fine-tuning them on a target task and improve fine-tuning of ResNet-50 and ConvNeXt.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/677b3dd7063395f4242dc2e2200a4a27b013e36b.pdf
Improved Logical Reasoning of Language Models via Differentiable Symbolic Programming,2022,ICML,"['Hanlin Zhang', 'Ziyang Li', 'Jiani Huang', 'Mayur Naik', 'Eric Xing']",poster,[],"Pre-trained large language models (LMs) struggle to perform logical reasoning reliably despite advances in scale and compositionality.

We propose DSR-LM, a Differentiable Symbolic Reasoning framework where pre-trained LMs govern the perception of factual knowledge, and a symbolic module equipped with provenance generates top-k proofs by deductive reasoning. In contrast to works that rely on hand-crafted logic rules, our differentiable symbolic reasoning architecture efficiently learns weighted rules to further improve LMs. DSR-LM is scalable, interpretable, and allows easy integration of prior knowledge, thereby supporting extensive symbolic programming to robustly derive a logical conclusion. Our experiments show that DSR-LM leads to improved logical reasoning of pre-trained LMs and outperforms a spectrum of competitive baselines even under systematic distribution shifts on sequence lengths.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/9c6e266e2035d92d8759f6a972c766894aabe781.pdf

Vote for Nearest Neighbors Meta-Pruning of Self-Supervised Networks,2022,ICML,"['Haiyan Zhao', 'Tianyi Zhou', 'Guodong Long', 'Jing Jiang', 'Chengqi Zhang']",poster,[],"Pruning plays an essential role in deploying deep neural nets (DNNs) to the hardware of limited memory or computation. However, current high-quality iterative pruning can create a terrible carbon footprint when compressing a large DNN for a wide variety of devices and tasks. Can we reuse the pruning results on previous tasks to accelerate the pruning for a new task? Can we find a better initialization for a new task? We study this ``nearest neighbors meta-pruning'' problem by first investigating different choices of pre-trained models for pruning under limited iterations. Our empirical study reveals several advantages of the self-supervision pre-trained model when pruned for multiple tasks. We further study the overlap of pruned models for similar tasks and how the overlap changes for different layers. Inspired by these discoveries, we develop a simple but strong baseline ``Meta-Vote Pruning (MVP)'' that significantly reduces the pruning iterations for a new task by initializing a sub-network from the pruned models of tasks similar to it.

We distinguish between and discuss self-supervised training tasks that induce localized and global features of speech based on their temporal granularity: noting that self-supervised representation learning frameworks based on the masked language-modeling objective -- such as wav2vec-2.0 and HuBERT -- induce localized embeddings, we define a self-supervised learning framework based on SimSiam for learning global features of speech. Through our evaluations, we find that these global representations are better suited for tasks such as depression detection and emotion classification while the localized embeddings of speech can be very useful in tasks such as speech-command detection; we also find that our proposed model outperforms TRILL -- a popular model for learning global representations. Finally, we also propose and confirm empirically that combining the global and localized representations of speech helps obtain better performance across a range of downstream tasks than each of the individual embedding methods.

Specifically, we show that different data modalities (e.g. images and text) are embedded at arm's length in their shared representation in multi-modal models such as CLIP. Our systematic analysis demonstrates that this gap is caused by a combination of model initialization and contrastive learning optimization. In model initialization, we show empirically and theoretically that the representation of a common deep neural network is restricted to a narrow cone. As a consequence, in a multi-modal model with two encoders, the representations of the two modalities are clearly apart when the model is initialized. During optimization,  contrastive learning keeps the different modalities separate by a certain distance, which is influenced by the temperature parameter in the loss function. Our experiments further demonstrate that varying the modality gap distance has a significant impact in improving the model's downstream zero-shot classification performance and fairness.

However, the reasons for better generalization are not fully understood.  Recent works provide empirical arguments suggesting flat minima generalize better. While recently proposed contrastive pre-training methods have also been shown to improve generalization, there is an incomplete understanding of the loss landscape of these models and why they generalize well. In this work, we analyze the loss landscape of contrastive trained models on the CIFAR10 dataset by looking at three sharpness measures: (1) the approximate eigenspectrum of the Hessian, (2) (CŒµ, A)-sharpness, and (3) robustness to adversarial gradients (RAG), a new efficient measure of sharpness.

Yet foundation models pose a clear dual-use risk, indiscriminately reducing the costs of building both harmful and benign machine learning systems. To mitigate this risk, we propose the task blocking paradigm, in which foundation models are trained with an additional mechanism to impede adaptation to harmful tasks while retaining good performance on desired tasks. We call the resulting models self-destructing models, inspired by mechanisms that prevent adversaries from using tools for harmful purposes.

RL-Tune: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Assisted Layer-wise Fine-Tuning Approach for Transfer Learning,2022,ICML,"['Tanvir Mahmud', 'Natalia Frumkin', 'Diana Marculescu']",poster,"['novel fine-tuning', 'transfer-learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'learning-rate scheduling']","Data scarcity is one of the major challenges in many real-world applications. To handle low-data regimes, practitioners often take an existing pre-trained network and fine-tune it on a data-deficient target task. In this setup, a network is pre-trained on a source dataset and fine-tuned on a different, potentially smaller, target dataset. We address two critical challenges with transfer learning via fine-tuning: (1) The required amount of fine-tuning greatly depends on the distribution shift from source to target dataset. (2) This distribution shift greatly varies by layer, thereby requiring layer-wise adjustments in fine-tuning to adapt to this distribution shift while preserving the pre-trained network's feature representation. To overcome these challenges, we propose RL-Tune, a layer-wise fine-tuning framework for transfer learning which leverages reinforcement learning to adjust learning rates as a function of the target data shift. In our RL framework, the state is a collection of the intermediate feature activations generated from training samples. The agent generates layer-wise learning rates as actions for fine-tuning based on the current state and obtains sample accuracy as the reward. RL-Tune outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on standard transfer learning benchmarks by a large margin, e.g., 6% mean accuracy improvement on CUB-200-2011 with 15% data.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/c3dcc098a06010ba0f47a32a029f147e3a2d72d3.pdf

Limited by the specific observations of the environment, these methods ignore the possibility of exploring diverse real-world image datasets. In this paper, we investigate how a visual RL agent would benefit from the off-the-shelf visual representations. Surprisingly, we find that the early layers in an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet model could provide rather generalizable representations for visual RL. Hence, we propose Pre-trained Image Encoder for Generalizable visual reinforcement learning (PIE-G), a simple yet effective framework that can generalize to the unseen visual scenarios in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on DMControl Generalization Benchmark, DMControl Manipulation Tasks, and Drawer World to verify the effectiveness of PIE-G. Empirical evidence suggests PIE-G can significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalization performance. In particular, PIE-G boasts a 55% generalization performance gain on average in the challenging video background setting.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/70e88e8cba3ab1714edce79cc97501d9214165d1.pdf

We show that the differences between methods can be understood more clearly by investigating the RM directly, which allows for a more detailed comparison. To this end, we propose a framework and new metric to measure and compare different RMs. We also investigate and report on the RM characteristics for various pretraining methods. These characteristics are measured by applying sequentially larger local alterations to the input data, using white noise injections and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) adversarial attacks, and then tracking each datapoint. We calculate the total distance moved for each datapoint and the relative change in distance between successive alterations. We show that self-supervised methods learn an RM where alterations lead to large but constant size changes, indicating a smoother RM than fully supervised methods.

This approach first pre-trains a representation function using large unlabeled datasets from multiple tasks by self-supervised (e.g., contrastive) learning, and then learns a simple classifier on the representation using small labeled datasets from the downstream target tasks. The representation should have two key properties: label efficiency (i.e., ability to learn an accurate classifier with a small amount of labeled data) and universality (i.e., usefulness across a wide range of downstream tasks). In this paper, we focus on contrastive learning and systematically study the trade-off between label efficiency and universality both theoretically and empirically.

We first show the asymptotic convergence of this method to a Nash equilibrium of MPGs for tabular softmax policies. Second, we derive the finite-time performance of the policy gradient in two settings: 1)  using the log-barrier regularization, and 2) using the natural policy gradient under the best-response dynamics (NPG-BR). Finally, extending the notion of price of anarchy (POA) and smoothness in normal-form games, we introduce the POA for MPGs and provide a POA bound for NPG-BR.

Such models proceed by specifying the behavior of individuals (agents) and their interactions, and parameterizing the process of infection based on such interactions based on the geography and demography of the city. However, such models are computationally very expensive, and the complexity is often linear in the total number of agents. This seriously limits the usage of such models for simulations, which often have to be run hundreds of times for policy planning and even model parameter estimation. An alternative is to develop an emulator, a surrogate model that can predict the Agent-Based Simulator's output based on its initial conditions and parameters. In this paper, we discuss a Deep Learning model based on Dilated Convolutional Neural Network that can emulate such an agent based model with high accuracy. We show that use of this model instead of the original Agent-Based Model provides us major gains in the speed of simulations, allowing much quicker calibration to observations, and more extensive scenario analysis. The models we consider are spatially explicit, as the locations of the infected individuals are simulated instead of the gross counts. Another aspect of our emulation framework is its divide-and-conquer approach that divides the city into several small overlapping blocks and carries out the emulation in them parallelly, after which these results are merged together. This ensures that the same emulator can work for a city of any size, and also provides significant improvement of time complexity of the emulator, compared to the original simulator.

Currently, efforts in both geometric deep learning and, more broadly, deep learning applied to biomolecular tasks have been hampered by a scarcity of appropriate datasets accessible to domain specialists and machine learning researchers alike. To address this, we introduce Graphein as a turn-key tool for transforming raw data from widely-used bioinformatics databases into machine learning-ready datasets in a high-throughput and flexible manner. Graphein is a Python library for constructing graph and surface-mesh representations of biomolecular structures, such as proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules, and biological interaction networks for computational analysis and machine learning. Graphein provides utilities for data retrieval from widely-used bioinformatics databases for structural data, including the Protein Data Bank, the AlphaFold Structure Database, chemical data from ZINC and ChEMBL, and for biomolecular interaction networks from STRINGdb, BioGrid, TRRUST and RegNetwork. The library interfaces with popular geometric deep learning libraries: DGL, Jraph, PyTorch Geometric and PyTorch3D though remains framework agnostic as it is built on top of the PyData ecosystem to enable inter-operability with scientific computing tools and libraries.  Graphein is designed to be highly flexible, allowing the user to specify each step of the data preparation, scalable to facilitate working with large protein complexes and interaction graphs, and contains useful pre-processing tools for preparing experimental files. Graphein facilitates network-based, graph-theoretic and topological analyses of structural and interaction datasets in a high-throughput manner. We envision that Graphein will facilitate developments in computational biology, graph representation learning and drug discovery. \\

Intelligent Digital Twins can Accelerate Scientific Discovery and Control Complex Multi-Physics Processes,2022,ICML,"['Arden Phua', 'Gary W Delaney', 'Peter S. Cook', 'Chris H.J. Davies']",poster,"['Digital Twins', 'Additive Manufacturing', 'Gaussian Processes']","The emerging area of Intelligent Digital Twins (IDTs) offers great potential as a new paradigm for accelerating scientific discovery, while also offering state-of-the-art functionality in controlling complex physical processes. We investigate this concept for the case of an Intelligent Digital Twin of metal additive manufacturing (AM). Metal AM is an excellent choice for utilising an IDT due to the process being an inherently complex multi-physics one, with key elements including granular powder flow, laser melting and material solidification. This complexity means that computational simulations are extremely costly and obtaining high quality experimental data is extremely difficult, so optimal exploration of the parameter space using all available information on the current uncertainty in the region of interest is highly desirable. Our Intelligent Digital Twin for this process includes a complete description of the target geometry of the object being printed and a set of data-driven and computational models for the different physical processes occurring in the system. The data-driven models consist of a set of Gaussian Processes (GP) that can be trained using combinations of real world sensor data and outputs from computational simulations. We illustrate the utility of our IDT by determining optimal input print parameters and obtaining Pareto fronts between competing priorities such as surface roughness and print time. We also demonstrate the potential of the IDT as an intelligent control system to respond to errors during the print process and dynamically improve final print quality.

Reinforced Genetic Algorithm for Structure-based Drug Design,2022,ICML,"['Tianfan Fu', 'Wenhao Gao', 'Connor W. Coley', 'Jimeng Sun']",poster,"['molecule generation', 'molecule optimization']","Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to discover drug candidates by finding molecules (ligands) that bind tightly to a disease-related protein (targets), which is the primary approach to computer-aided drug discovery.
Recently, applying deep generative models for three-dimensional (3D) molecular design conditioned on protein pockets to solve SBDD has attracted much attention, but their formulation as probabilistic modeling often leads to unsatisfactory optimization performance. 
On the other hand, traditional combinatorial optimization methods such as genetic algorithms (GA) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various molecular optimization tasks. However, they do not utilize protein target structure to inform design steps but rely on a random-walk-like exploration, which leads to unstable performance and no knowledge transfer between different tasks despite the similar binding physics.
To achieve a more stable and efficient SBDD, we propose Reinforced Genetic Algorithm that uses neural models to prioritize the profitable design steps and suppress random-walk behavior. 
The neural models take the 3D structure of the targets and ligands as inputs and are pre-trained using native complex structures to utilize the knowledge of the shared binding physics from different targets and then fine-tuned during optimization. 
We conduct thorough empirical studies on optimizing binding affinity to various disease targets and show that Reinforced Genetic Algorithm outperforms the baselines in terms of docking scores and is more robust to random initializations. The ablation study also indicates that the training on different targets helps improve the performance by leveraging the shared underlying physics of the binding processes.

In this study, we develop a novel multi-view augmentation mechanism to improve subgraph representation learning models and thus the accuracy of downstream prediction tasks.

Given two metastable conformational states of a molecular system, \eg\ a folded and unfolded protein, we aim to sample the most likely transition path between the two states. Sampling such a transition path is computationally expensive due to the existence of high free energy barriers between the two states. To circumvent this, previous work has focused on simplifying the trajectories to occur along specific molecular descriptors called Collective Variables (CVs). However, finding CVs is not trivial and requires chemical intuition. For larger molecules, where intuition is not sufficient, using these CV-based methods biases the transition along possibly irrelevant dimensions. Instead, this work proposes a method for sampling transition paths that consider the entire geometry of the molecules. To achieve this, we first relate the problem to recent work on the Schrodinger bridge problem and stochastic optimal control. Using this relation, we construct a method that takes into account important characteristics of molecular systems such as second-order dynamics and invariance to rotations and translations. We demonstrate our method on the commonly studied Alanine Dipeptide, but also consider larger proteins such as Polyproline and Chignolin.

Although various methods have been proposed, it is still under-explored what knowledge the networks learn from the pre-training tasks and how it relates to downstream properties. In this work, with an emphasis on chemical molecular graphs, we fill in this gap by devising a range of node-level, pair-level, and graph-level probe tasks to analyse the representations from pre-trained graph neural networks (GNNs). We empirically show that: 1. Pre-trained models have better downstream performance compared to randomly-initialised models due to their improved the capability of capturing global topology and recognising substructures. 2. However, randomly initialised models outperform pre-trained models in terms of retaining local topology.

Unifying physical systems‚Äô inductive biases in neural ODE using dynamics constraints,2022,ICML,"['Yi Heng Lim', 'Muhammad Firmansyah Kasim']",poster,"['neural ode', 'physics', 'energy conservation', 'constraints']","Conservation of energy is at the core of many physical phenomena and dynamical systems. There have been a significant number of works in the past few years aimed at predicting the trajectory of motion of dynamical systems using neural networks while adhering to the law of conservation of energy. Most of these works are inspired by classical mechanics such as Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics as well as Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. While these works have been shown to work well in specific domains respectively, there is a lack of a unifying method that is more generally applicable without requiring significant changes to the neural network architectures. In this work, we aim to address this issue by providing a simple method that could be applied to not just energy-conserving systems, but also dissipative systems, by including a different inductive bias in different cases in the form of a regularisation term in the loss function. The proposed method does not require changing the neural network architecture and could form the basis to validate a novel idea, therefore showing promises to accelerate research in this direction.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/1c175d78650c2bf69354fe55bec27a5d2d1296ed.pdf
PowerGraph: Using neural networks and principal components to determine multivariate statistical power trade-offs,2022,ICML,"['Ajinkya K Mulay', 'Sean P Lane', 'Erin Hennes']",poster,"['statistical power', 'transfer learning']","Statistical power estimation for studies with multiple model parameters is inherently a multivariate problem. Power for individual parameters of interest cannot be reliably estimated univariately since correlation and variance explained relative to one parameter will impact the power for another parameter, all usual univariate considerations being equal. Explicit solutions in such cases, especially for models with many parameters, are either impractical or impossible to solve, leaving researchers to the prevailing method of simulating power. However, the point estimates for a vector of model parameters are uncertain, and the impact of inaccuracy is unknown. In such cases, sensitivity analysis is recommended such that multiple combinations of possible observable parameter vectors are simulated to understand power trade-offs. A limitation to this approach is that it is computationally expensive to generate sufficient sensitivity combinations to accurately map the power trade-off function in increasingly high-dimensional spaces for the models that social scientists estimate. This paper explores the efficient estimation and graphing of statistical power for a study over varying model parameter combinations. We propose a simple and generalizable machine learning inspired solution to cut the computational cost to less than 10% of the brute force method while providing F1 scores above 90%.

In this paper, we discuss the role of Explainable AI in scientific discovery process by demonstrating an Explainable AI-based paradigm for science discovery. The key is to use Explainable AI to help derive data or model interpretations, hypotheses, as well as scientific discoveries or insights. We show how computational and data-intensive methodology---together with experimental and theoretical methodology---can be seamlessly integrated for scientific research.

LAST: Latent Space Assisted Adaptive Sampling for Protein Trajectories,2022,ICML,"['Hao Tian', 'Xi Jiang', 'Sian Xiao', 'Hunter La Force', 'Eric Larson', 'Peng Tao']",poster,"['Variational Autoencoder', 'Molecular Dynamics', 'Adaptive Sampling']","Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is widely used to study protein conformations and dynamics. However, conventional simulation suffers from being trapped in some local energy minima that are hard to escape. Thus, most computational time is spent sampling in the already visited regions. This leads to an inefficient sampling process and further hinders the exploration of protein movements in affordable simulation time. The advancement of deep learning provides new opportunities for protein sampling. Variational autoencoders are a class of deep learning models to learn a low-dimensional representation (referred to as the latent space) that can capture the key features of the input data. Based on this characteristic, we proposed a new adaptive sampling method, latent space assisted adaptive sampling for protein trajectories (LAST), to accelerate the exploration of protein conformational space. This method comprises cycles of (i) variational autoencoders training, (ii) seed structure selection on the latent space and (iii) conformational sampling through additional MD simulations. The proposed approach is validated through the sampling of four structures of two protein systems: two metastable states of E. Coli adenosine kinase (ADK) and two native states of Vivid (VVD). In all four conformations, seed structures were shown to lie on the boundary of conformation distributions. Moreover, large conformational changes were observed in a shorter simulation time when compared with conventional MD (cMD) simulations in both systems. In metastable ADK simulations, LAST explored two transition paths toward two stable states while cMD became trapped in an energy basin. In VVD light state simulations, LAST was three times faster than cMD simulation with a similar conformational space.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/2029465fd9e4d208f477b1e8e557fb27ef8614b5.pdf

In this study, we present a general framework for transfer learning PINNs that results in one-shot inference for linear systems of both ordinary and partial differential equations. This means that highly accurate solutions to many unknown differential equations can be obtained instantaneously without retraining an entire network. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed deep learning approach by solving several real-world problems, such as first- and second-order linear ordinary equations, the Poisson equation, and the time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger complex-value partial differential equation.

Without explicit governing equations, conventional physical-based inversion techniques are not feasible and data-driven inversion requires expensive full labels. To overcome this issue, we proposed a new data-driven multi-physics inversion technique with extremely weak supervision. Our key finding is that the pseudo labels can be constructed by learning the local relationship among geophysical properties at very sparse locations. We explore the multi-physics inversion problem from two distinct measurements~(seismic and electromagnetic data) to three geophysical properties~(velocity, conductivity, and $\mathrm{CO_2}$ saturation) with synthetic data based on the Kimberlina storage reservoir in California.

We propose a novel framework to systematically evaluate exploration measures for drug candidate generation. The framework is built upon three formal analyses: an axiomatic analysis that validates the potential measures analytically, an empirical analysis that compares the correlations of the measures to a proxy gold standard, and a practical analysis that benchmarks the effectiveness of the measures in an optimization framework of molecular generation.

We begin by reviewing the principles of grid cell mechanism and function obtained from analytical and first-principles modeling efforts, then consider the claims of deep learning models of grid cells and rigorously examine their results under varied conditions. Using large-scale hyperparameter sweeps and hypothesis-driven experimentation, we demonstrate that the results of such models may reveal more about particular and non-fundamental implementation choices than fundamental truths about neural circuits or the loss function(s) they might optimize.

MeshGraphNets relies on a message passing graph neural network to propagate information, and this structure becomes a limiting factor for high-resolution simulations, as equally distant points in space become further apart in graph space. First, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn accurate surrogate dynamics of a high-resolution system on a much coarser mesh, both removing the message passing bottleneck and improving performance; and second, we introduce a hierarchical approach (MultiScale MeshGraphNets) which passes messages on two different resolutions (fine and coarse), significantly improving the accuracy of MeshGraphNets while requiring less computational resources.

Assuming that the data generating mechanism involves interpretable concepts, we prove that our method is able to identify them while attaining optimal classification accuracy. We use synthetic experiments for validation, and also show that on the ChestXRay dataset, CLAP effectively discovers interpretable factors for classifying diseases.

SOC describes the buildup of large-scale and long-range spatio-temporal correlations as a result of only local interactions and dissipation. The simulation of SOC dynamics is typically based on Monte-Carlo (MC) methods, which are however numerically expensive and do not scale beyond certain system sizes. We investigate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as an effective surrogate model to learn the dynamics operator for a paradigmatic SOC system, inspired by an experimentally accessible physics example: driven Rydberg atoms. To this end, we generalize existing GNN simulation approaches to predict dynamics for the internal state of the node. We show that we can accurately reproduce the MC dynamics as well as generalize along the two important axes of particle number and particle density. This paves the way to model much larger systems beyond the limits of traditional MC methods. While the exact system is inspired by the dynamics of Rydberg atoms, the approach is quite general and can readily be applied to other systems.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/a0b56365f6890cb03bb5bc5092707d24956e2f96.pdf

In this work, we design a general solution operator for two different time-independent PDEs using graph neural networks (GNNs) and spectral graph convolutions. We train the networks on simulated data from a finite elements solver on a variety of shapes and inhomogeneities. In contrast to previous works, we focus on the ability of the trained operator to generalize to previously unseen scenarios. Specifically, we test generalization to meshes with different shapes and superposition of solutions for a different number of inhomogeneities. We find that training on a diverse dataset with lots of variation in the finite element meshes is a key ingredient for achieving good generalization results in all cases. With this, we believe that GNNs can be used to learn solution operators that generalize over a range of properties and produce solutions much faster than a generic solver.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in solving challenging problems across various aspects of computational molecular optimizations, emphasizing high validity, diversity, and, most recently, synthesizability. Despite this progress, many papers report results on trivial or self-designed tasks, bringing additional challenges to directly assessing the performance of new methods. Moreover, the sample efficiency of the optimization---the number of molecules evaluated by the oracle---is rarely discussed, despite being an essential consideration for realistic discovery applications. To fill this gap, we have created an open-source benchmark for practical molecular optimization, PMO, to facilitate the transparent and reproducible evaluation of algorithmic advances in molecular optimization. This paper thoroughly investigates the performance of 25 molecular design algorithms on 23 tasks with a particular focus on sample efficiency. Our results show that most ""state-of-the-art"" methods fail to outperform their predecessors under a limited oracle budget allowing 10K queries and that no existing algorithm can efficiently solve certain molecular optimization problems in this setting. We analyze the influence of the optimization algorithm choices, molecular assembly strategies, and oracle landscapes on the optimization performance to inform future algorithm development and benchmarking.

To improve reliability, we developed ViT-Plex and T5-Plex, pretrained large model extensions (plex) for vision and language modalities, respectively. Plex greatly improves the state-of-the-art across reliability tasks, and simplifies the traditional protocol as it does not require designing scores or tuning the model for each individual task. We demonstrate scaling effects over model sizes up to 1B parameters and pretraining dataset sizes up to 4B examples. We also demonstrate Plex's capabilities on challenging tasks including zero-shot open set recognition, active learning, and uncertainty in conversational language understanding.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/99b15deb9a66c6af60390b9fe676c27e5f368160.pdf
OOD-CV: A Benchmark for Robustness to Individual Nuisances in Real-World Out-of-Distribution Shifts,2022,ICML,"['Bingchen Zhao', 'Shaozuo Yu', 'Wufei Ma', 'Mingxin Yu', 'Shenxiao Mei', 'Angtian Wang', 'Ju He', 'Alan Yuille', 'Adam Kortylewski']",poster,[],"Enhancing the robustness of vision algorithms in real-world scenarios is challenging. One reason is that existing robustness benchmarks are limited, as they either rely on synthetic data or ignore the effects of individual nuisance factors. We introduce ROBIN, a benchmark dataset that includes out-of-distribution examples of 10 object categories in terms of pose, shape, texture, context and the weather conditions, and enables benchmarking models for image classification, object detection, and 3D pose estimation. Our experiments using popular baseline methods reveal that: 1) Some nuisance factors have a much stronger negative effect on the performance compared to others, also depending on the vision task. 2) Current approaches to enhance robustness have only marginal effects, and can even reduce robustness. 3) We do not observe significant differences between convolutional and transformer architectures. We believe our dataset provides a rich testbed to study robustness and will help push forward research in this area.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/8d4f2c9577af2b881e37d332f4cb6dd97e7c70ad.pdf
Wild-Time: A Benchmark of in-the-Wild Distribution Shift over Time,2022,ICML,"['Huaxiu Yao', 'Caroline Choi', 'Yoonho Lee', 'Pang Wei Koh', 'Chelsea Finn']",poster,[],"Distribution shifts occur when the test distribution differs from the training distribution, and can considerably degrade performance of machine learning models deployed in the real world. While recent works have studied robustness to distribution shifts, distribution shifts arising from the passage of time have the additional structure of timestamp metadata. Real-world examples of such shifts are underexplored, and it is unclear whether existing models can leverage trends in past distribution shifts to reliably extrapolate into the future. To address this gap, we curate Wild-Time, a benchmark of 7 datasets that reflect temporal distribution shifts arising in a variety of real-world applications. On these datasets, we systematically benchmark 9 approaches with various inductive biases. Our experiments demonstrate that existing methods are limited in tackling temporal distribution shift: across all settings, we observe an average performance drop of 21% from in-distribution to out-of-distribution data.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/26431d69ad58b0be7588c06236570f52edefd940.pdf
"Growing ObjectNet: Adding speech, VQA, occlusion, and measuring dataset difficulty",2022,ICML,"['David Mayo', 'David Lu', 'Chris Zhang', 'Jesse Cummings', 'Xinyu Lin', 'Boris Katz', 'James R. Glass', 'Andrei Barbu']",poster,[],"Building more difficult datasets is largely an ad-hoc enterprise, generally relying on scale from the web or focusing on particular domains thought to be challenging. ObjectNet is an attempt to create a more difficult dataset, one that eliminates biases that may artificially inflate machine performance, in a systematic way. ObjectNet images are meant to decorrelate objects from their backgrounds, have randomized object orientations, and randomized viewpoints. ObjectNet appears to be much more difficult for machines. Spoken ObjectNet is a retrieval benchmark constructed from spoken descriptions of ObjectNet images. These descriptions are being used to create a captioning and VQA benchmark. In each case large performance drops were seen. The next variant of ObjectNet will focus on real-world occlusions since it is suspected that models are brittle when shown partially-occluded objects. Using large-scale psychophysics on ObjectNet we have constructed a new objective difficulty benchmark applicable to any dataset: the minimum presentation time for an image before the object contained within it can be reliably recognized by humans. This difficulty metric is well predicted by quantities computable from the activations of models, although not necessarily their ultimate performance. We hope that this suite of benchmarks will enable more robust models, prove better images for neuroscientific and behavioral experiments, and contribute to a systematic understanding of the dataset difficulty and progress in computer vision.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/74271083ece3be2f48ae98c25ad273684006978c.pdf
Classifiers Should Do Well Even on Their Worst Classes,2022,ICML,"['Julian Bitterwolf', 'Alexander Meinke', 'Valentyn Boreiko', 'Matthias Hein']",poster,[],"The performance of a vision classifier on a given test set is usually measured by its accuracy. For reliable machine learning systems, however, it is important to avoid the existence of areas of the input space where they fail severely. To reflect this, we argue, that a single number does not provide a complete enough picture even for a fixed test set, as there might be particular classes or subtasks where a model that is generally accurate performs unexpectedly poorly. Without using new data, we motivate and establish a wide selection of interesting worst-case performance metrics which can be evaluated besides accuracy on a given test set. Some of these metrics can be extended when a grouping of the original classes into superclasses is available, indicating if the model is exceptionally bad at handling inputs from one superclass.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/0628b94f7f7db235a19799743e1d6de2d8348414.pdf
Lost in Translation: Modern Image Classifiers still degrade even under simple Translations,2022,ICML,"['Leander Kurscheidt', 'Matthias Hein']",poster,[],"Modern image classifiers are used potentially in safety-critical applications and thus should not be vulnerable to natural transformations of the image as it can happen due to variations in the image acquisition.
While it is known that image classifiers can degrade significantly in performance with respect to translations and rotations, the corresponding works did not ensure that the object of interest is fully contained in the image and also introduce boundary artefacts so that the input is not a natural image. In this paper we leverage pixelwise segmentations of the ImageNet-S dataset in order to search for the translation and rotation which ensures that the object is i) fully contained in the image (potentially together with a zoom) and ii) the image is natural (no padding with black pixels) such that the resulting natural image is misclassified. We observe a consistent drop in accuracy over a large set of image classifiers showing that natural adversarial changes are an important threat model which deserves more attention.

Towards Systematic Robustness for Scalable Visual Recognition,2022,ICML,"['Mohamed Omran', 'Bernt Schiele']",poster,[],"There is widespread interest in developing robust classification models, that can handle challenging object, scene, or image properties. While work in this area targets diverse kinds of robust behaviour, we argue in this work in favour requirement that should apply more generally: For robust behaviour to be scalable, it should transfer flexibly across familiar object classes, and not be separately learned for every class of interest. To this end, we propose the systematic robustness setting, in which certain combinations of classes and attributes are systematically excluded during training. Unlike prior work which studies systematic generalisation in DNNs or their susceptibility to spurious correlations, we use synthetic operations and data sampling to scale such experiments up to large-scale naturalistic datasets. This allows for a compromise between ecological validity of the task and strict experimental controls. We analyse a variety of models and learning objectives, and find that robustness to different shifts such as image corruptions, image rotations, and abstract object depictions are perhaps harder to deal with than previous results would suggest. This extended abstract describes the general experimental setting, our specific instantiations, and a metric to measure systematic robustness.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/fea96ed8aac8dc5cd6650449b97d3b35f90c312f.pdf
Evaluating Model Robustness to Patch Perturbations,2022,ICML,"['Jindong Gu', 'Volker Tresp', 'Yao Qin']",poster,"['Natural Patch Corruption', 'Adversarial Patch', 'Vision Transformer']","Recent advances in Vision Transformer (ViT) have demonstrated its impressive performance in image classification, which makes it a promising alternative to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Unlike CNNs, ViT represents an input image as a sequence of image patches. The patch-based input image representation makes the following question interesting: How does ViT perform when individual input image patches are perturbed with natural corruptions or adversarial perturbations, compared to CNNs? In this submission, we propose to evaluate model robustness to patch-wise perturbations. Two types of patch perturbations are considered to model robustness. One is natural corruptions, which is to test models' robustness under distributional shifts. The other is adversarial perturbations, which are created by an adversary to specifically fool a model to make a wrong prediction. The experimental results on the popular CNNs and ViTs are surprising. We find that ViTs are more robust to naturally corrupted patches than CNNs, whereas they are more vulnerable to adversarial patches. Given the architectural traits of state-of-the-art ViTs and the interesting results above, we propose to add the robustness to natural patch corruption and adversarial patch attack into the robustness benchmark.",https://api.openreview.net/pdf/d1beaaf2ecfedd7f613e348b86d58b54fda3af18.pdf

CCC: Continuously Changing Corruptions,2022,ICML,"['Ori Press', 'Steffen Schneider', 'Matthias Kuemmerer', 'Matthias Bethge']",poster,"['robustness', 'test-time adaptation', 'continual adaptation', 'gradual adaptation']",Many existing datasets for robustness and adaptation evaluation are limited to static distribution shifts. We propose a well-calibrated dataset for continuously changing image corruptions on ImageNet scale. Our benchmark builds on the established common corruptions of ImageNet-C and extends them by applying two corruptions at the same time with finer-grained severities to allow for smooth transitions between corruptions. The benchmark contains random walks through different corruption types with different controlled difficulties and speeds of domain shift. Our dataset can be used to benchmark test-time and domain adaptation algorithms in challenging settings that are closer to real-world applications than typically used static adaptation benchmarks.,https://api.openreview.net/pdf/7b7ecc3a9635d1dd0f968341c6d41d81f5516680.pdf

The primary distinction of the proposed transformations is that, unlike existing approaches such as Common Corruptions, the geometry of the scene is incorporated in the transformations ‚Äì thus leading to corruptions that are more likely to occur in the real world. We apply these corruptions to the ImageNet validation set to create 3D Common Corruptions (ImageNet-3DCC) benchmark. The evaluations on recent ImageNet models with robustness mechanisms show that ImageNet-3DCC is a challenging benchmark for object recognition task. Furthermore, it exposes vulnerabilities that are not captured by Common Corruptions, which can be informative during model development.
